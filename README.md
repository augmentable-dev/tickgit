## tickgit üéüÔ∏è

Tickets as config. Manage your repository's tickets and todo items as configuration files in your codebase. Use the `tickgit` command to view a snapshot of pending items, summaries of completed items, and historical reports of progress using `git` history.


```hcl
# rocketship.tickgit

goal "Build the Rocketship üöÄ" {
    description = "Finalize the construction of the Moonblaster 2000"

    task "Construct the engines" {
        status = "done"
    }

    task "Attach the engines" {
        status = "pending"
    }

    task "Thoroughly test the engines" {
        status = "pending"
    }
}
```

```
$ tickgit status
=== Build the Rocketship üöÄ ‚è≥
  --- 1/3 tasks completed (2 remaining)
  --- 33% completed

  ‚úÖ Construct the engines
  ‚è≥ Attach the engines
  ‚è≥ Thoroughly test the engines
```

### Why is this useful?

To be honest, I'm not sure yet. This project is a POC I'm exploring. Keeping tickets next to the code they're meant to describe could have the following benefits:

- Tickets live with the code, no need for a 3rd party tool or system (anyone with git access to the repository has access to contributing to the tickets)
- Updating a ticket's status and merging/committing code are the same action, no need to synchronize across multiple tools
- Source of truth for a project's ticket history is now the git history, which can be queried and analyzed
- Current status of a `goal` can be reported by simply parsing the repository's `head`
- Less context switching between the codebase itself and the system describing "what needs to be done"


### Installation

#### Homebrew

```
brew tap augmentable-dev/tickgit
brew install tickgit
```


### Usage

The most up to date usage will be the output of `tickgit --help`. The most common usage, however, is `tickgit status` which will print a status report of tickets for a given git repository. By default, it uses the current working directory.
